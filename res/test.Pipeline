# A simple test build file with two indendent steps and a final step that
# depends on them. Note that the commands are NOT supposed to exist so that
# this build file will fail when run (although a clean would succeed)

step1:
    command: "xformxyz i{1,2,3}.txt"
    inputs:
        - i1.txt
        - i2.txt
        - i3.txt
    outputs:
        - o1.txt
        - o2.txt
        - o3.txt
    clean: [a.aux, b.log]

step2:
    command: cmd1xyz
    inputs:
        - test.txt
    outputs:
        - output.bin

depstep:
    command: cmd2xyz
    inputs:
        - o3.txt
        - output.bin
    outputs:
        - combination.output
    clean:
        - need-cleaning.1
        - need-cleaning.2
        - need-cleaning.3
